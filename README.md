# Installation:
Download the zip via `github.com/nightmare-tech/PWD_Vault` or clone it via git :-
```
git clone https://nightmare-tech/PWD_Vault
```
It is a very small repository. So, I didn't need another way to install it. And itâ€™s the easiest :)

# Run Locally:
### Create a virtual env so that it does not break default lib versions 
```
cd PWD_Vault
python -m venv .
source bin/activate
```
!!!  Install the necessary packages !!!

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- For Windows users:
    Click on the batch file `PWD_Vault.bat` from your file manager or execute the batch file by typing
    `PWD_Vault.bat` in your console in the cloned directory (Windows Terminal, cmd etc.) 
    
- For Linux users:
    Make the bash script executable (only need to do one time) :-
    ```
    chmod +x PWD_Vault.sh
    ```
    Then running the bash script:-
    ```
    ./PWD_Vault.sh
    ```

- Alternative: 
  Run the python file `PWD_Vault.py` in the directory `PWD_Vault` directly:-
  ```
  cd PWD_Vault
  python3 PWD_Vault.py
  ```
    This is what the .bat and .sh scripts do. It just looks neat this way :)
